        "This notebook is a shortened version of a notebook used for internal Kaggle competition. The task was to identyfy user based on their browsing patterns. In essence this was a binary classification task. The dataset was highly imbalanced. Quite a lot of cells have been removed for clarity and only ones that contributed to succesful results were left. To me, the most optimal solution resulted from applying undersampling, using CatBoost classifier and stratifiedKfold to reduce number of features"
